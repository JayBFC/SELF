# SELF

SELF is a simple python module which allows you to check if a website's content contains certain text. You can also choose whether or not it is case sensitive. If you were wondering, SELF stands for 'Simple Easy Link Filtering'

# USAGE

Using SELF is very simple. All you have to do is import it and use the following code:
```python
SELF.filter_web('https://example.com', 'Content to check / filter', False)
#Use False if it is not case sensitive
#Use True if it is case sensitive
```

# INFORMATION

This project was mainly made for repl.it, but you can use it in your own project. It is targeted and tested for / with python3 and may not be compatible with python 2.7, though you can still give it a try. This project is subject to change and I, the creator, can change anything or even completely disband the project at any time.
